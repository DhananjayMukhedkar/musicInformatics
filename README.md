# musicInformatics
This project deals with music instrument classification.We use the Medley-DB and use a subset of it to classify 7 instruments.The project is divided into 2 parts:

1.project_part1_featureExtract.ipynb : The first part does the feature extractions and saves the feature files

2.project_part2_classify.piynb : The second part reads from the extracted files and does the classification.

#root_path : Change this variable to the root path of the dataset

#filesuffix : (optional) Set this parameter to add suffix to feature file for file id 

The feature_files contain the extracted features files.
